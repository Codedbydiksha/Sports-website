    <h3>About Volleyball</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Volleyball</strong> is a popular team sport where two teams of six
      players hit a ball over a high net, aiming to ground it on the opponent's
      court, with each team allowed three touches before returning it. Invented
      in <strong>1895</strong> by <strong>William G. Morgan</strong> as a less
      vigorous alternative to basketball, it's played globally, involving skills
      like serving, passing, setting, and spiking, with points scored on
      successful plays or opponent errors, played in sets, typically to 25
      points.
