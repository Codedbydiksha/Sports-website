    <h3>About Badminton</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Badminton</strong> is a fast-paced racket sport where players hit
      a shuttlecock over a net, aiming to land it in the opponent's court,
      played as singles (1v1) or doubles (2v2). It's played indoors
      professionally on a rectangular court with specific lines, using
      lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock (birdie). Games use a<strong>
        21-point </strong
      >rally scoring system, requiring a two-point lead to win a game, with the
      first to two games winning the match.
