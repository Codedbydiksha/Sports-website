    <h3>About Basketball</h3>
    <p>
      <strong> Basketball </strong>is a popular team sport where two teams of
      <strong>5</strong> players score by shooting a ball through an elevated
      hoop (basket) on a rectangular court, using skills like dribbling,
      passing, and shooting to outscore opponents, a game invented in 1891 by
      James Naismith. Points are awarded for shots (2 or 3 points), and the game
      involves offense (scoring) and defense (preventing scores), with rules
      governing movement and fouls. Inventor: <strong> Naismith </strong>in
      <strong>1891</strong> for indoor fitness. Evolution: Started with peach
      baskets; evolved with metal hoops, backboards, and rules like the
      three-point shot. Global Sport: Popular worldwide, with major leagues like
      the <strong>NBA (USA) </strong>and <strong>FIBA (International)</strong>.
