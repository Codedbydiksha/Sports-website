    <h3>About Football</h3>
    <p>
      <strong> Football (or soccer)</strong> is the world's most popular sport,
      a team game where two teams of <strong>11</strong> players try to score
      goals by kicking or heading a ball into the opponent's net, using feet,
      head, and chest but not hands (except for the goalkeeper). Key aspects
      include teamwork, dribbling, passing, and shooting, with major tournaments
      like the
      <strong>FIFA</strong>
      World Cup uniting fans globally, featuring stars like
      <strong>Lionel Messi</strong> and <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong>, and
      <strong>Sunil Chhetri</strong> evolving with technology like VAR.
